White means you have nudged each other less than 3 times, green means you have nudged each other between 3 and 50 times, pink is between 50 and 200, and blue is anything over 200. These values may change in the future, but the purpose will remain the same. At a glance of the map you can see the people you nudge the most. In the future there will be incentives for reaching a new tier with someone."
